# ML_Assignment_1

CSC3022F Machine learning assignment 1 - ANN

This project contains multiple python programs where each program is an artifical neural network with
different topology.

In order to run any of these programs begin by creating the virtual enviroment by typing

"make install"

next activate the enviroment with
"source ./venv/bin/activate"

once this is done you can run any of the programs with python3 Classifier_x.py

Note that a majority of the python code was taken from the pytorch example script and tutorial 1 script.
Comments in the code indicate where it was taken from.
